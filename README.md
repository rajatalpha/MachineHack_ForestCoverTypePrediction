# MachineHack_ForestCoverTypePrediction
This repo gives the full approach and code for Machinehack Forest Cover type Classification. Here LGBM model gave a final log loss score of 0.33, Which I would like to improve to around 0.1. I also added weights to the predictions and 5 fold cross validation. I used Bayesian Optimization to get optimized parameters.
